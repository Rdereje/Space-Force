# Space Force

Command POTUS Donald Trump's US Space Force as the spaceman sitting in the Tesla that Elon Musk shot into space. Orbit the Earth's Atmosphere and destroy alien invaders.
- Side-scrolling level-based space shooter loosely based off the Space Impact game from yesteryear's Nokia phones
- Enemies fly toward you as you progress from left to right and blast them, sometimes receiving power-ups
- Each level ends with a boss

# Goals:

-Create a side scrolling platform for our game to reside in
-Create enemies for our hero to fight in the form of alien invaders
-Create end-level bosses that will pose a challenge to the player
-Involve power-ups that effects the players abilities
-Implement acceleration/deceleration, gravitational pull, collision detection to provide advanced physics
-Implement a limited amount of 3D graphics elements to provide a more visually pleasing aspect for our game
-Implement a networked multiplayer aspect to the game to enjoy with friends from anywhere
