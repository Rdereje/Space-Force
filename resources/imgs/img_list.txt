LIST OF ART FOR THE GAME

*Since everyone is expected to do some artsy stuff, anyone can change this list/take a list item and make it.
*If you do make one, place your name(s) next to it (see "Title screen" below as example) so everyone can get credit for artistic elements.
*The theme to go for is 80s retro arcade style; use any art program but keep the theme in mind. 
*The 3D graphics crew will let everyone know what aspects will be 3D as time goes on.
